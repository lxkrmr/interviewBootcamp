# The Coding Interview Bootcamp

This is a following along of the Udemy Course "The Coding Interview Bootcamp" by Stephen Grider in Java.

## Exercises

### 1. String Reversal

Implement the following method ...

    com.example.interviewbootcamp.StringReversal.reverse

... to meet this requirement:

    Given a String, return a new String with the reversed order of characters.

Run the following test to check your implementation:
    
    com.example.interviewbootcamp.StringReversalTest

And let us assume that we are not allowed to use any existing "reverse" method, like:

    new StringBuilder("foo").reverse().build

### 2. Palindromes

Implement the following method ...

    com.example.interviewbootcamp.Palindromes.palindrome

... to meet this requirement:

   Given a String, return true if the String is a palindrom or false if it is not.
   Palindromes are strings that form the same word if it is reversed.

Run the following test to check your implementation:

    com.example.interviewbootcamp.PalindromesTest

Let us assume again that we are not allowed to use any existing "reverse" method.
Even if we know that this isn't smething we want to ship to production.
