# 1. Integer Reversal

Implement the following method ...

    com.example.interviewbootcamp.IntReversal.reverse

... to meet this requirement:

    Given an int, return an int that is the reverse odering of numbers.
    In addition, if the number is negative then keep the sign.
    And make sure that the reversed number is an int, so no leading zeros ;)

Run the following test to check your implementation:

    com.example.interviewbootcamp.IntReversalTest

And once more, let us assume that we are not allowed to use any existing "reverse" method, like:

    new StringBuilder("foo").reverse().build
