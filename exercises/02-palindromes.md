# 2. Palindromes

Implement the following method ...

    com.example.interviewbootcamp.Palindromes.palindrome

... to meet this requirement:

Given a String, return true if the String is a palindrom or false if it is not.
Palindromes are strings that form the same word if it is reversed.

Run the following test to check your implementation:

    com.example.interviewbootcamp.PalindromesTest

Let us assume again that we are not allowed to use any existing "reverse" method.
Even if we know that this isn't smething we want to ship to production.
